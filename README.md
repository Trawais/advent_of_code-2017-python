## Advent of Code - 2017 in Python
This repository has been created for educational purposes.
I'm teaching my fiancee the basics of computer programming in Python language.
The solution should be always easy and readable for the very beginner.

All tasks are done as a series of unit tests.
Tasks are taken from the game [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017) for the year __2017__.

### Requirements
The whole projest is developed in Python `v3.7.4`, 
but I believe any 3.* version of Python should work.

### Install
Init your virtual environemt:
```
virtualenv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Install all dependcies from `requirements.txt` file: 
```

```

### Run
